<h2>Boabeng-Fiema and its colobus population</h2>
<img style="width: 459px; height: 244px;" alt="Research Project Colobus" src="SatMap.png" />
<p>This eco-tourism site is located close to the villages Boabeng and
Fiema in central Ghana, West Africa.
The
monkeys are protected by traditional taboos and more recently  by laws,
and this site contains one of few remaining large populations of
white-thighed
colobus. Therefore, research at this site is key for improving conservation outlooks of this species. I am investigating the links between environmental conditions, dispersal and social relationships, health and fitness, genetic structure, and population viability.
 This research is done in collaboration with <a href="http://antharky.ucalgary.ca/sicotte/index.htm">Pascale
Sicotte</a> at the University of Calgary and <a href="http://molecular-anthro.uoregon.edu/TingLab/">
Nelson Ting</a> at the University of Oregon.

<h2>The gut microbiome</h2>
<img style="width: 459px; height: 244px;" alt="Research Project Colobus" src="ColobusMicrobiome.jpeg" />
<p>To investigate gut microbiome structure and its fitness consequences, I combine several years of detailed ecological data, behavioral
observations, and fecal DNA samples from several study groups. Groups have distinct
gut microbiomes, due to differential habitat use and sociality. Natal and
founder females, but not immigrant females, have similar microbiomes to
other group members <a href="%20Wikberg%20et%20al%202016%20Between%20and%20within%20group%20variation%20in%20the%20gut%20microbiome%20of%20a%20black-and-white%20colobus%20monkey.pdf%20">(Wikberg
et al. 2016)</a>. High-ranking females with diverse gut microbiomes
have the highest reproductive output. This finding leaves open the
possibility that a diverse microbiome helps allocate resources to
reproduction, but future analyses are necessary to establish the
cause-and-effect relationship.

<h2>Long-term changes in social structure</h2>
<img style="width: 459px; height: 244px;" alt="Research Project Colobus" src="WallEating.jpg" />
<p>The colobus population at Boabeng Fiema has increased rapidly
during the last ten years. This increase in population density has been
accompanied by increased rates of within-group and between-group
female-female aggression while male-male aggression has remained
stable. I am investigating whether this increase in female aggression is due to
decreased per capita food abundance in collaboration with <a href="http://antharky.ucalgary.ca/sicotte/index.htm">Pascale
Sicotte</a> and Tania Saj at the University of Calgary, <a href="http://julieteichroeb.com/">Julie
Teichroeb</a> at the University of Toronto, and <a href="http://www.cicasp.pri.kyoto-u.ac.jp/people/andrew-macintosh">Andrew

<h2>Dispersal patterns</h2>
<img style="width: 459px; height: 244px;" alt="Research Project Colobus" src="ColobusGeneticNetworks.jpg" />
<p>I use a combination of demographic and genetic data
to gain a more complete understanding of male and female dispersal
patterns.
All males disperse from their groups, most
likely to
increase their reproductive opportunities <a href="Teichroeb%20et%20al%202011%20Dispersal%20in%20male%20ursine%20colobus%20monkeys.pdf">(Teichroeb
et al. 2011)</a>.
Approximately half of the
females disperse while the other half remain in
their natal group to breed
<a href="Wikberg%20et%20al%202012%20Between-group%20variation%20in%20dispersal.pdf">(Wikberg
et al. 2012)</a>.
Females transfer from large groups with frequent female-female
aggression to smaller groups
<a href="Teichroeb%20et%20al%202009%20Female%20dispersal%20patterns%20in%20six%20groups%20of%20ursine.pdf">(Teichroeb
et al. 2009)</a>.
Many females
emigrate from the
main fragment with high population density, and they may settle
in the surrounding fragments with lower population density and habitat
quality.

<h2>Feeding competition</h2>
<img style="width: 459px; height: 244px;" alt="Research Project Colobus" src="PopulationDen.jpg" />
<p>Colobus monkeys are highly folivorous, and leaves are often assumed
not
to be worth fighting over
due to a widespread distribution and a relatively low nutritional
quality. Although female colobus only
occasionally
displace other group members for access to food, they form linear
dominance
hierarchies that are either weakly or strongly expressed
<a href="Wikberg%20et%20al%202013%20Individualistic%20female%20dominance%20hierarchies.pdf">(Wikberg
et al. 2013)</a>.
Females aggressively participate in between-group encounters, particularly when the
encounter occurs in the core area of their home range <a href="http://primate-society.com/ips/public/ips_program/IPS10-653.pdf">(Wikberg
&amp; Sicotte 2010)</a>. Females that frequently participate together in between-group
encounters have stronger grooming relationships than others, indicating that
forming strong bonds facilitates cooperative home range defense.

<h2>Social relationships</h2>
<img style="width: 459px; height: 244px;" alt="Research Project Colobus" src="ColobusSocialNetwork.jpg" />
<p>Because of the flexible dispersal pattern in
the colobus females at Boabeng-Fiema, I am able to tease
apart the effect that familiarity and kinship have on social bonds. Females bias grooming to
familiar female kin, but not to recent immigrant kin <a href="Wikberg%20et%20al%202014%20Familiarity%20is%20more%20important%20than%20phenotypic%20similarity.pdf">(Wikberg
et al. 2014a)</a>
.
As a result, the social network is structured by kinship in
groups that consist of long-term resident females and by immigration status in groups with recent
immigrant females <a href="Wikberg%20et%20al%202014%20Kinship%20and%20residency%20status%20structure%20female%20social%20networks.pdf">(Wikberg
et al. 2014b)</a>. Between-group differences in social
network metrics were not predicted by the kin composition of groups but
by
other demographic factors like the presence of infants and group
stability <a href="Wikberg%20et%20al%202015%20Demographic%20factors.pdf">(Wikberg
et al. 2015)</a>.
