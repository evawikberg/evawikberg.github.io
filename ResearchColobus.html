<h2>Boabeng-Fiema and its colobus population</h2>
<img style="width: 459px; height: 244px;" alt="Research Project Colobus" src="SatMap.png" />
<p>This eco-tourism site is located close to the villages Boabeng and
Fiema in central Ghana, West Africa.
The
monkeys here are protected by traditional taboos and more recent laws,
and this site contains one of few remaining large populations of
white-thighed
colobus. Boabeng-Fiema is a relatively large forest fragment that
is connected
to other smaller fragments via narrow
forest corridors. This area consists of a mosaic
of different habitat types, such as primary forest, derived savanna,
disturbed forest, riverine forest, and recently abandoned farm land.
The habitat mosaic offers an excellent opportunity to investigate how
ecological factors affect dispersal patterns and social relationships.
I investigate this topic using a combination of behavioral,
ecological, and genetic data collection and data analysis techniques.
For my doctoral project, I collected data during 25 months at
Boabeng-Fiema, under the supervision of <a href="http://antharky.ucalgary.ca/sicotte/index.htm">Dr. Pascale
Sicotte</a> at the University of Calgary. I also spent one year
genotyping DNA samples in <a href="http://molecular-anthro.uoregon.edu/TingLab/">
Dr. Nelson Ting's</a> laboratory.
I continue to collaborate with Drs. Sicotte and Tig on topics
related to the gut microbiome, genetic structure, social structure, and
infant development.

<h2>The gut microbiome</h2>
<img style="width: 459px; height: 244px;" alt="Research Project Colobus" src="ColobusMicrobiome.jpeg" />
<p>Although the gut microbiome is linked to host health, no study to
date has described a link between the gut microbiome and differential
rates of reproduction. As a matter of fact, most previous microbiome
analyses of wild primates lacked contextual information. My study
combines several years of detailed ecological data, behavioral
observations, and fecal DNA samples from several study groups with
known differences in ecological and social factors. There is a strong
seasonal effect on the gut microbial composition. Groups have distinct
gut microbiomes, partly due to differential habitat use. Natal and
founder females, but not immigrant females, have similar microbiomes to
other group members <a href="%20Wikberg%20et%20al%202016%20Between%20and%20within%20group%20variation%20in%20the%20gut%20microbiome%20of%20a%20black-and-white%20colobus%20monkey.pdf%20">(Wikberg
et al. 2016)</a>. High-ranking females with diverse gut microbiomes
have the highest reproductive output. This finding leaves open the
possibility that a diverse microbiome helps allocate resources to
reproduction, but future analyses are necessary to establish the
cause-and-effect relationship.

<h2>Long-term changes in social structure</h2>
<img style="width: 459px; height: 244px;" alt="Research Project Colobus" src="WallEating.jpg" />
<p>The colobus population at Boabeng Fiema has increased rapidly
during the last ten years. This increase in population density has been
accompanied by increased rates of within-group and between-group
female-female aggression while male-male aggression has remained
stable. We suspect that this increase in female aggression is due to
decreased per capita food abundance. I am currently investigating
whether or not this is the case in collaboration with <a href="http://antharky.ucalgary.ca/sicotte/index.htm">Dr. Pascale
Sicotte</a> and Dr. Tania Saj at the University of Calgary, <a href="http://julieteichroeb.com/">Dr. Julie
Teichroeb</a> at the University of Toronto, and <a href="http://www.cicasp.pri.kyoto-u.ac.jp/people/andrew-macintosh">Dr.

MacIntosh</a> at Kyoto University.

<h2>Dispersal patterns</h2>
<img style="width: 459px; height: 244px;" alt="Research Project Colobus" src="ColobusGeneticNetworks.jpg" />
<p>I use a combindation of demographic and genetic data
to gain a more complete understanding of male and female dispersal
patterns in the white-thighed colobus population at Boabeng-Fiema.
All males disperse from their groups, most
likely to
increase their reproductive opportunities <a href="Teichroeb%20et%20al%202011%20Dispersal%20in%20male%20ursine%20colobus%20monkeys.pdf">(Teichroeb
et al. 2011)</a>.
Approximately half of the
females disperse while the other half remain in
their natal group to breed
<a href="Wikberg%20et%20al%202012%20Between-group%20variation%20in%20dispersal.pdf">(Wikberg
et al. 2012)</a>.
Females transfer from large groups with frequent female-female
aggression to smaller groups
<a href="Teichroeb%20et%20al%202009%20Female%20dispersal%20patterns%20in%20six%20groups%20of%20ursine.pdf">(Teichroeb
et al. 2009)</a>.
Many females
emigrate from the
main fragment with high population density, and they may settle
in the surrounding fragments with lower population density and habitat
quality.

<h2>Feeding competition</h2>
<img style="width: 459px; height: 244px;" alt="Research Project Colobus" src="Populationden.jpg" />
<p>Colobus monkeys are highly folivorous, and leaves are often assumed
not
to be worth fighting over
due to a widespread distribution and a relatively low nutritional
quality. Although female colobus only
occasionally
displace other group members for access to food, they form linear
dominance
hierarchies that are either weakly or strongly expressed
<a href="Wikberg%20et%20al%202013%20Individualistic%20female%20dominance%20hierarchies.pdf">(Wikberg
et al. 2013)</a>.
The colobus occasionally feed on contestable
food items such as seed pods and palm nuts that may provide sufficient
incentive to maintain
decided dominance relationships. Females in the primary forest show
aggression during
between-group encounters at higher rates than females in the
savanna. Females are more likely to show aggression when the
encounter occurs in the core area of their home range <a href="http://primate-society.com/ips/public/ips_program/IPS10-653.pdf">(Wikberg
&amp; Sicotte 2010)</a>. Furthermore,
females that frequently participate together in between-group
encounters form stronger grooming relationships than others. These
results indicate that
forming strong bonds facilitates cooperative home range defense, which
is one
of the main predictions for why females should
remain in their natal group and form strong bonds with female kin.

<h2>Social relationships</h2>
<img style="width: 459px; height: 244px;" alt="Research Project Colobus" src="ColobusSocialNetwork.jpg" />
<p>In many wild mammals, females remain in their natal group and
form strong, long-lasting bonds with their mother and other maternal
kin. It is still under debate whether or not this pattern evolved
due to indirect fitness benefits gained from interacting with kin or
due to direct fitness benefits gained from interacting with familiar
individuals. Because of the flexible dispersal pattern in
the colobus females at Boabeng-Fiema, females reside with familiar and
unfamiliar kin and non-kin. This offers a unique opportunity to tease
apart the effect
that familiarity and kinship have on social bonds. Females groom
familar female kin more often than other group members, and they do not
bias affiliation towards recent immigrant kin <a href="Wikberg%20et%20al%202014%20Familiarity%20is%20more%20important%20than%20phenotypic%20similarity.pdf">(Wikberg
et al. 2014a)</a>
.
As a result, kinship has a positive effect on the social network in
groups that consist of long-term residents while immigration status is
more important in shaping the social networks in groups with recent
immigrants <a href="Wikberg%20et%20al%202014%20Kinship%20and%20residency%20status%20structure%20female%20social%20networks.pdf">(Wikberg
et al. 2014b)</a>. Surprisingly, between-group differences in social
network metrics were not predicted by the kin composition of groups but
by
other demographic factors like the presence of infants and group
stability <a href="Wikberg%20et%20al%202015%20Demographic%20factors.pdf">(Wikberg
et al. 2015)</a>.
